            A vacation is when you take a trip to some {adjective_1} place with your {adjective_2} family. Usually you go to some place
            that is near a/an {noun_1} or up on a/an {noun_2}. A good vacation place is one where you can ride {plural_noun_1} or play 
            {game_1} or go hunting for {plural_noun_2} . I like to spend my time {verb_ending_in_ing_1} or {verb_ending_in_ing_2}. When 
            parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three {plural_noun_3} a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit 
            around {verb_ending_in_ing_3}. Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an {noun_3} and got poison {plant_1} all over his 
            {part_of_the_body_1}. My family is going to go to (the) {a_place_1}, and I will practice {verb_ending_in_ing_4}. Parents 
            need vacations more than kids because parents are always very {adjective_3} and because they have to work {number_1} hours 
            every day all year making enough {plural_noun_4} to pay for the vacation.
